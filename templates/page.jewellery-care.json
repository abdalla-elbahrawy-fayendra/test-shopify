Avoid harsh chemicals and keep them apart to avoid scratches.</p><p><strong>Moissanite </strong>Moissanite is nearly as hard as diamond, which makes it scratch-resistant. Regularly clean with warm, soapy water or a light jewelry cleaner. Avoid harsh chemicals and store separately to avoid contact with other gemstones.</p><p><strong>Emeralds </strong>Emeralds are delicate and prone to chipping. Avoid using ultrasonic cleaners or steamers and instead clean gently with warm water and a soft towel. Keep away from severe temperatures and keep them carefully to avoid damage.</p><p><strong>Alexandrite </strong>Alexandrite is resilient, but may lose its color-changing effect when exposed to severe chemicals. Wash with warm, soapy water and a gentle brush. To avoid scratches, store in a soft pouch and keep out of direct sunlight.</p><p><strong>Aquamarine </strong>Aquamarine is rather hard, but can be damaged by sharp strikes. Clean with warm, soapy water and a delicate brush, but avoid ultrasonic cleaners. Store separately to avoid scratches and protect against harsh chemicals.</p><p><strong>Morganite </strong>Morganite is relatively delicate, so clean it gently with warm, soapy water. Avoid harsh chemicals and preserve it separately from harder gemstones.</p>"

Store Silver jewelry separately to avoid scratches from other pieces.</p><p><strong>Platinum</strong><p><strong>Steel</strong> Stainless steel is durable and tarnish-resistant, yet it can still absorb dirt and oil. Use a soft cloth and warm, soapy water to clean your steel jewelry. For harder stains, use a jewelry cleaner made exclusively for stainless steel. Store in a dry place to avoid moisture damage.</p>"
